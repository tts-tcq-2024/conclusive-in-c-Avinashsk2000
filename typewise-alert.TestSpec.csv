1,Handling Invalid Cooling Type (Less Than),TC001,test_GetTemperatureLimitsInvalidCoolingTypeLessThan,CoolingType(-1),"Exit with error: ""Error: Invalid cooling type.""",Ensures the function exits with an error when an invalid cooling type below the expected range is provided.
2,Handling Invalid Cooling Type (Greater Than),TC002,test_GetTemperatureLimitsInvalidCoolingTypeGreaterThan,CoolingType(3),"Exit with error: ""Error: Invalid cooling type.""",Ensures the function exits with an error when an invalid cooling type above the expected range is provided.
3,Valid Cooling Types Limits Retrieval,TC003,test_GetTemperatureLimitsValidCoolingTypes,"PASSIVE_COOLING, MED_ACTIVE_COOLING, HI_ACTIVE_COOLING","Correct limits for each cooling type: {0, 35}, {0, 40}, {0, 45} respectively",Verifies that correct temperature limits are returned for valid cooling types.
4,Breach Type Inference (TOO_LOW),TC004,test_InferBreachLowTemperature,"value = 10, lowerLimit = 20, upperLimit = 30",TOO_LOW,Checks if the breach is correctly inferred as TOO_LOW when the temperature is below the lower limit.
5,Breach Type Inference (TOO_HIGH),TC005,test_InferBreachHighTemperature,"value = 35, lowerLimit = 20, upperLimit = 30",TOO_HIGH,Checks if the breach is correctly inferred as TOO_HIGH when the temperature is above the upper limit.
6,Breach Type Inference (NORMAL),TC006,test_InferBreachNormalTemperature,"value = 25, lowerLimit = 20, upperLimit = 30",NORMAL,Checks if the breach is correctly inferred as NORMAL when the temperature is within the limits.
7,Controller Alert for Breach (TOO_LOW),TC007,test_SendToControllerWithBreachType,breachType = TOO_LOW,Calls sendToController with breachType = TOO_LOW,Verifies the function sends the correct breach type to the controller.
8,s,TC008,test_SendToEmailNormal,breachType = NORMAL,"Sends email: ""Temperature is normal""",Ensures the email alert for NORMAL breach type is triggered and message is sent.
9,Email Alert for Breach (TOO_LOW),TC009,test_SendToEmailLowTemperature,breachType = TOO_LOW,"Sends email: ""Hi, the temperature is too low""",Ensures the email alert for TOO_LOW breach type is triggered and message is sent.
10,Email Alert for Breach (TOO_HIGH),TC010,test_SendToEmailHighTemperature,breachType = TOO_HIGH,"Sends email: ""Hi, the temperature is too high""",Ensures the email alert for TOO_HIGH breach type is triggered and message is sent.
11,Handling Invalid Breach Type for Email,TC011,test_SendToEmailInvalidBreachType,breachType = -1,"Exit with error: ""Error: Invalid breach type for email notification.""",Ensures the function exits with an error when an invalid breach type is provided for email notification.
12,Controller Alert Handling,TC012,test_HandleAlertControllerTarget,"alertTarget = TO_CONTROLLER, breachType = TOO_HIGH",Calls sendToController with breachType = TOO_HIGH,Verifies that the controller receives the correct breach type when the target is set to TO_CONTROLLER.
13,Email Alert Handling,TC013,test_HandleAlertEmailTarget,"alertTarget = TO_EMAIL, breachType = TOO_LOW",Calls sendToEmail with breachType = TOO_LOW,Verifies that the email alert is triggered with the correct breach type when the target is set to TO_EMAIL.
14,Invalid Alert Target Handling,TC014,test_HandleAlertInvalidTarget,"alertTarget = -1, breachType = TOO_HIGH","Exit with error: ""Error: Invalid alert target.""",Ensures the function exits with an error when an invalid alert target is provided.
15,High Temperature Alert,TC015,test_CheckAndAlertHighTemperature,"target = TO_EMAIL, coolingType = HI_ACTIVE_COOLING, temperature = 46",Calls sendToEmail with breachType = TOO_HIGH,Verifies that an email alert with TOO_HIGH breach type is sent when the temperature exceeds HI_ACTIVE_COOLING limit.
16,Normal Temperature Alert,TC016,test_CheckAndAlertNormalTemperature,"target = TO_EMAIL, coolingType = PASSIVE_COOLING, temperature = 25",Calls sendToEmail with breachType = NORMAL,Ensures the email alert with NORMAL breach type is sent when temperature is within the limit.
17,Low Temperature Alert,TC017,test_CheckAndAlertLowTemperature,"target = TO_EMAIL, coolingType = MED_ACTIVE_COOLING, temperature = -5",Calls sendToEmail with breachType = TOO_LOW,Verifies that an email alert with TOO_LOW breach type is sent when the temperature is below MED_ACTIVE_COOLING limit.
